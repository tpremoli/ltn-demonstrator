# Software Demonstrator for LTNs for RAMM

* [Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM)](https://rammuseum.org.uk/) and Diogo Pacheco (Computer Science, University of Exeter)

The Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM) is planning a transportation exhibition
for next summer.

Diego Pacheco from the Computer Science Department wants to support this
activity with an agent-based model to simulate the [low-traffic
neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Traffic_Neighbourhood).
Currently, there is a very heated debate going on with the active trial in
Heavitree (see <https://www.devon.gov.uk/news/heavitree-and-whipton-active-streets-trial-begins-today/>).

The goal of this project is to design a model where people can play around with
different parameters and understand the impact of these barriers. This could be
a great NetLogo project, but in addition to the ABM, the project will need to
have a good interface to allow public interaction.
