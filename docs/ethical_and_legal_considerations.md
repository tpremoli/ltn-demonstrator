# Ethical and Legal Considerations

Last reviewed: March 2023

## Introduction

Ethical and legal considerations are vital for this project as it models Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) and influences urban planning decisions. They ensure fairness, transparency, and community consent, while also guarding against legal complications. These considerations help maintain credibility and build trust within the communities the project impacts.  


## Ethics

1. **Data Privacy:** Sensitive information regarding occupants of the neighbourhood under consideration (e.g. Heavitree) might be used. It is important that this data is separated from the individual. Additionally, any real-world data must be made compliant with data protection laws, subject to location.
2. **Transparency:** The project's goals and intentions should be clear to any interested parties. Information about the collection and usage of data should be made available. 
3. **Bias and Fairness:** The team must ensure that the models do not disproportionately impact any particular group or community. Precautions should be made to reduce the risk of any conclusions drawn from the simulation disproportionately impacting any particular group or community (This includes people with limited mobility, economic inequality, race/creed, etc...). Provided the team has the capacity for consulting people with limited mobility or other disadvantages, they will be included to assist with fair representation of their experience. By regularly assessing and reviewing the fairness of the simulation, representation issues can be mitigated. If the team lacks capacity to fairly represent a specific group, its non-inclusion should be made explicit.
4. **Accountability:** Establish clear lines of responsibility. If the project results in any adverse effects, determine who is accountable and what measures will be taken to address these issues. 
5. **Minimisation of harm:** The team must strive to ensure that no damage is caused to individuals, communities, or the environment.
6. **Open access:** The client should consider making the project's findings, data, and models open and accessible to the public, allowing for transparency and independent review.
7. **Model Validation:** Validating the model is important since it might have real world implications. By validating the models, we can negate the risks detailed in 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5. 
8. **Equitable Access:** Ensure that the simulation is designed to be user-friendly, accessible, and comprehensible for individuals of all age groups, including those with diverse backgrounds, abilities, or technological literacy.
9. **Educational Purpose:** The simulation serves as an educational tool, facilitating an understanding of urban planning's complexities and societal impacts, while acknowledging its inherent limitations.
10. **Restrictions in Eductional Use:** Ethical considerations necessitate a careful appraisal of the simulation's use in educational settings, particularly in terms of age-appropriateness and potential biases influencing student perceptions. Considerations regarding accessability should also be covered.
11. **Community Involvement:** Active engagement with local communities is essential. This involves seeking their input, addressing their concerns, and incorporating their feedback into the LTN model. Such involvement ensures the model reflects diverse perspectives and real-world scenarios.
12. **Respect for Community Views:** Recognize and respect the varied views within the community, ensuring that all voices, especially those from marginalized groups, are heard and considered in the simulation's development.
13. **Consent and Privacy in Engagement:** Obtain informed consent for any data collection during community engagement activities, ensuring adherence to privacy and data protection standards.
14. **Simulation Veracity to Real Life:** By ensuring that all statistical values used are as similar to real-world values as possible, we can reduce the risk of misinformation. For example, ensuring that a vehicle (car) has emission rates equivilant to real life.

 
## Legal Considerations

1. **Intellectual Property (IP):** The team must be aware of the IP rights associated with algorithms, software, and data sources. Permission to use such resources must be acquired. Additionally, any IP generated by the team members during the duration of the project should be treated appropriately, and classified or licenced if necessary. 
2. **Data Protection Laws:** To accurately simulate the Heavitree neighborhood, data acquired from the local council regarding traffic movement should be acquired. This data will be subject to certain protective laws and may contain sensitive information. Accommodations must be made to ensure the data is secure and resistant to leakage.
3. **Liability:** Aspects of the simulation could result in potential damages or adverse consequences; the liability for such events must be determined. Waivers or disclaimers might be necessary to alleviate such events. 
4. **Copyright and Licencing:** Credit or recognition must be provided to any code or library used in the simulation. Copyright and open-source licencing terms must be respected. 
5. **Local Regulation:** Regulation determining data usage, mapping, and transparency will vary, and said variation should be accommodated by the local implementation. This project is being developed specifically for studying LTN's in Heavitree, Exeter, but should incorporate the flexibility to be applied to other neighbourhoods. 
6. **Environmental Regulations:** Since this project will consider environmental impact, we will need to ensure it complies with environmental regulations. Certain domains will have restrictions on travel and type of vehicle, or incentives to travel in certain ways. This regulations should be considered in the simulation or the simulation framework.
7. **Educational Licencing:** For educational deployment, the simulation requires specific licencing, ensuring compliance with academic standards and legal norms.
8. **Educational Use Compliance:** Ensure that the use of the LTN simulation in an educational setting complies with the terms of its existing licence. This might involve restrictions on how the simulation can be used for teaching purposes.
9. **Limitations for Educational Use:** Legal constraints, particularly in data privacy, must be rigorously observed when integrating the simulation into educational curricula.
10. **Compliance with Educational Standards:** Ensure that the use of the simulation aligns with educational standards and practices, particularly if it will be integrated into formal curricula.
11. **Public Consultation Requirements:** Adhere to legal requirements regarding public consultations for urban planning projects. Ensure that all community engagement activities comply with these regulations.
12. **Documentation and Record-Keeping:** Maintain thorough records of community consultations, feedback, and how this input is integrated into the project, to ensure transparency and accountability.


## Accountability and Liability

1. **Data Leak:** This project involves the processing of potentially sensitive data. Provided that the necessary steps to prevent leakage are implemented, liability for loss of data will be negated. Disclosures should be issued so that this threat is made aware of. 
2. **Incorrect Conclusions from Simulation:** Due to the complexity of simulating real life, solutions proposed by the simulation might not reflect reality. If this is made clear, users of the simulation (like Exeter city council) can make more informed decisions, and have awareness regarding consequences of certain implementations, as well as deviation from intended implementation. 
3. **Experimental Use by Public:** If this project is utilized by the RAMM and the public, the users must be informed that solutions discovered by the simulation do not equate directly to reality, and that the authority to implement such solutions belongs to governmental bodies. A disclaimer can be issued and/or signed by any user, accepting that the solutions proposed by the simulation are suggestions, not factual.
4. **Misinterpretation in Educational Contexts:** The risk of misinterpretation in educational contexts is acknowledged, necessitating clear guidelines and supplementary materials to ensure accurate comprehension.
5. **Responsiveness to Community Feedback:** Ensure there are clear mechanisms to respond to community concerns and feedback. Establish processes to adjust the project based on this input, mitigating any potential negative impacts on the community.
6. **Liability for Community Misunderstandings:** Address and clarify any misunderstandings that may arise from community engagement sessions, reducing the risk of misinformation and potential liability.
7. **Community Engagement Statement:** By Addressing the limitations of the project before initiating community engagement, we can help mitigate the risks. An example statement should include the following points:
   - 2. Incorrect Conclusions from Simulation.
   - 4. Misinterpretation in Educational Contexts.
   - 6. Liability for Community Misunderstandings.


## Community Engagement

1. **Engagement Strategy:** Develop a comprehensive strategy for community engagement, detailing how and when the community will be involved in the project.
2. **Diverse Participation:** Ensure the engagement strategy is inclusive, allowing for the participation of a wide range of community members, including those from underrepresented groups.
3. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement effective mechanisms for collecting and analyzing community feedback, such as surveys, public forums, and online platforms.
4. **Impact on Modeling:** Detail how community input will influence the LTN simulation, ensuring that the model remains relevant and reflective of community needs.


## Conclusion

Given the ethical and legal considerations outlined above, most aspects of the project do not require ethical approval (bar conferring with marginalized groups), as they involve minimal risk legally and ethically. If we decide to consult members of marginalized groups (limited mobility, race etc.), then this may change, hence, we will seek ethical approval from the university. Upon conference with our client, they agree with this decision.
