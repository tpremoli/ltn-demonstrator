# Project Description and Initial Requirements

## Project Description

Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) schemes are being introduced by the government all across the UK to tackle quality of life factors in certain areas, including air pollution and traffic congestion. These schemes put restrictions of travel on motor users via the use of barriers, planters and bollards without obstructing pedestrian or cyclists right of way. LTN schemes are a temporary measure that have the potential to be made permanent given a beneficial implementation.

This project aims to design a user-friendly software demonstrator for an LTN agent-based modelling simulation.

An agent-based model simulates individual or collective entities (or agents), usually used in order to understand the nature of a system and its statistical outcomes.

The simulation will be produced for Diogo Pachego for both educational and analytical uses. Educationally, the simulation will be designed with the Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM) in mind, as an educational exhibit to be displayed in summer 2024. One of the goals of this is to tackle a heated debate concerning the active traffic control trial in Heavitree through both education and interaction. The simulation will also be designed with the Exeter City Council in mind as an analytical tool, to this end it should be accurate and produce insight on some metrics key to a successful LTN scheme.

## Project Management Method

Our project team will be managed in an agile approach, following a weekly planning, executing, evaluating cycle. The project team will hold weekly meetings covering set objectives from the Kanban Board for the present week's cycle. The objectives for a given cycle will be chosen and taken ownership of based on the Kanban board constructed according to the high level project plan. This methodology promotes continuous collaboration and improvement within the group where communication is frequent, keeping a tight loop of feedback.

## Initial Requirements

The project is required to present an agent-based simulation model for an LTN scheme that can be presented as an educational and analytical tool. It should do this through the use of adjustable parameters to manipulate the resulting state of the model, allowing users to understand concepts of LTNs and their local area. The interactivity and visualisation of the simulation should be an educational tool for the users who interact with the project at RAMM as well as serving to clearly convey information to users at Exeter City Council that will be able to produce presentable findings to members of the council and the public for decision making purposes.

The minimum viable product (MVP) for this project should produce a rudimentary representation of key mechanics of a traffic simulator. These requirements are constructed to satisfy the key objectives of the client's expectations of a educational and analytical agent-based modelling and simulation tool. The simulation should have clearly visualised roads and agents in its environment. When a simulation has been run, statistics should be produced to represent key metrics derived from the project aim, accompanied by clear graphical representation of results to the user. These results should visualise the changes the user makes through interacting with the simulation environment.
